NAUT Games - Demos
=====

This repository contains source files for technical demonstrations published by NAUT games. 

##About the Demos
You can find information about the demos detailed in the github project wiki @ https://github.com/naut-games/demos/wiki. A brief overview of the demos is listed below.

### Neural Network
Demos/NeuralNet<br/>
_Language: AS3_<br/>
_Project Types: FlashDevelop, Flash IDE_<br/>
This demonstration contains a basic 3 layer feed-forward neural network that is trained via sigmoid function based back-propagation. A neural network of this type is suitable for most simple applications and specifically for games.

### Random Number Generator
Demos/Random<br/>
_Language: AS3_<br/>
_Project Types: FlashDevelop, Flash IDE_<br/>
This demonstration contains a seedable psuedo Random Number Generator (RNG) implemented using a Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) algorithm. This RNG is not suitable for encryption / security or generating large volumes of noise in real time. This generator does have many practical applications listed in the Random.as class header.
